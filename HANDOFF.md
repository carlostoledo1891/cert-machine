# HANDOFF — cert-machine

## What it is

A conjecture engine: generate mathematical objects at scale, screen in float,
**certify the survivors exactly**, and hunt closed forms for what survives.
Interval enclosures and exact rational decisions — a REFUTED here is proved.

```
make engine    generate → screen → certify; writes ledger.json   (~4 min)
make control   rebuild index.html from the ledger                (~40 s, runs batteries)
make test      every battery
make drift     re-hash the lift against the source lab
```

## State, measured at handoff

## The five families

| family | output | result so far |
|---|---|---|
| `newman-minmod` | min\|f\| on \|z\|=1 for 0/1 polynomials | 4 certified; one adopted into the envelope (17-term, min\|f\| ≥ 1.4141441147942588) |
| `chowla-cosine` | Chowla merit c = −min f_A/√\|A\| | 295 certified below 1 |
| `oeis-closedform` | audits 14,593 published OEIS constants | 77.6M forms refuted, **0 discoveries** — the corpus is curated, every survivor already had its form on record |
| `henon-orbits` | **certified existence + uniqueness** of Hénon periodic orbits | 228 theorems, calibrated against the closed-form fixed points |
| `henon-census` | **the EXACT number** of period-p points, plane exhausted | 328/328 cells; at a=1.4: exactly 4 period-7 and 7 period-8 orbits (matches Galias); p=12 = 248 points/19 orbits in 52 s |

The census (`instruments/census/henon-census.js`) is the completeness record
the field survey said nobody publishes for non-SAT numerics: a certified a
priori bound confines every periodic point, interval tube iteration excludes,
Krawczyk-as-contraction resolves each remainder to exactly one point, and
minimal periods are decided by certified shift-links — never by tolerance.
It can refuse; it can never return a wrong count. Two bugs were found exactly
the way the method predicts: by a red control (the fat-record stall at a=0.96,
p=4 — caught by the shift classification, not by reading code).

## Next steps, in order

1. **Higher periods at the classical parameters.** p=12 certifies in 52 s with
   the Krawczyk-contraction pruning; the wall is the anisotropic tube near the
   strongly unstable fixed point (cost ~4× per period step). p=13..16 likely
   need either the detach runner or a smarter box metric. Each new p at
   a=1.4 is a publishable exact count.
2. **A second map for the census.** The argument only needs a quadratic a
   priori bound and a polynomial recurrence — Ikeda needs interval sin/cos
   (transcendental.js is sound), the cubic Hénon and the standard-map family
   are direct ports. One instrument, one new family file each.
3. **`keller-audit`: certify the Jacobian-conjecture counterexamples.** On
   2026-07-19 Alpöge refuted the Jacobian conjecture in dimension 3 (found
   with Claude; Gallagher's infinite family 07-20, Speyer's tangent-sweep
   geometry 07-23, Gao's arXiv:2608.00222 survey; n=2 REMAINS OPEN). Verified
   in-session by two independent exact routes: for
   P=(1+xy)³z+y²(1+xy)(4+3xy), Q=y+3x(1+xy)²z+3xy²(4+3xy), R=2x−3x²y−x³z,
   det J ≡ −2 is a POLYNOMIAL IDENTITY over Q (symbolic, every monomial
   cancels; hand partials cross-checked by exact Lagrange interpolation), and
   (0,0,−1/4), (1,−3/2,13/2), (−1,3/2,13/2) all map to (−1/4,0,0) exactly.
   Build the family: a corpus of the published explicit maps (Alpöge,
   Gallagher, Meng–Yang's Hessian counterexample, Zhang's consequences), each
   certified or refuted exactly; red control: one perturbed coefficient must
   break the identity. A calibration corpus whose ground truth is five weeks
   old — the exact opposite of OEIS staleness.
4. **`keller-search`: collision hunting in Keller-map ansätze.** The Alpöge
   map is z-AFFINE with coefficients in {±1..±4} — inside an enumerable
   grammar. enumerate: structured ansätze F = A(x,y)·z + B(x,y); screen:
   exact Keller filter (det J ≡ const, symbolic over Q — the instrument seed
   already exists from the audit) then float Newton on F(u)−F(v)=0; certify:
   exact rational collision or a Krawczyk box. Discovery targets, honestly
   ranked: minimal-degree counterexample (the literature is weeks old; likely
   open), counterexamples outside the tangent-sweep class, geometric-degree
   censuses ("EXACTLY d preimages, certified" — the census shape), and for
   the OPEN plane case certified exclusions: "no collision in this family,
   proved" (Moh already gives degree ≤ 100, so plane statements are
   exclusion-only until the ansatz outgrows it).
5. **More Krawczyk families.** Any parameterised nonlinear system: steady
   states of reaction-diffusion, roots of polynomial systems.
6. **Do NOT go back to closed-form hunting over curated corpora.** OEIS was the
   right calibration target and the wrong discovery target, and the reason is
   structural and predictable in advance. (The keller corpus is not this:
   its claims are new, explicit, and decidable by our instruments.)

## The rule for changing front

A front is worth another run while the marginal run still moves one of two
numbers: **discovery yield** (new certified objects nobody holds) or **instrument
yield** (bugs found, capability gained). The OEIS run scored 0 discovery and high
instrument — three real bugs, including the engine refuting √2 as a closed form
for the decimal expansion of √2. The *next* OEIS run would have scored zero on
both. Estimate both before the run, from the structure of the corpus.

## Adding a family

One file in `families/`, six functions, no registration —
`enumerate(i)`, `value(obj)`, `interesting(obj,v)`, `certify(obj)`, `key(obj)`,
plus `name`/`statement`. `tools/run-engine.js` picks up every `.js` there.
The screen may only ever PRUNE; nothing is admitted without an exact certificate.

**Whatever you build, calibrate it against a case with a known answer, and give
it a red control that can actually fire.** Every real bug this project has found
was found that way, and none by reading code.

## The one rule

`/Users/carlostoledo/Documents/sin-mfg` is **read-only, permanently.** Read
anything — numbers, literature, instruments, records. Never edit a file, never
change the tree; find an error there and report it rather than repair it. That
lab pins evidence by path and sha256, so an edit demotes a certified claim.

Copies come out through `LIFT.json` → `PROVENANCE.json`; `make drift` re-hashes
both ends. Patches to lifted files are declared so they cannot be mistaken for
drift.
